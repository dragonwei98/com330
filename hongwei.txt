My name is Hong Wei Tan and I am a transfer student from Malaysia.
In the US, I will usually introduce myself as Joey because I find it easier for someone to remember my name with that. I am currently in my third-year as a Mechanical Engineering and this year will be start of my second year in this beautiful windy city, Chicago.

When I was in high school, I was fascinated with the knowledge that I learnt from my sciences subject. It unlocked the dimension of my boundary significantly, so I was aspired to be an engineer to serve the society with the skill that I am passionate about.

In this Fall 2018 semester, I enrolled into a web design class under the course code COM330 and I am looking forward to learning to design a webpage.
The goal that I wish to get out from this class is to earn the ability to code in languages that are applicable in real life which are html, css and java script.  I find the importance to learn how publicity tools work, especially a website because it is an important communication with the audience or customers.
I hope I will be able to produce a personal webpage which showcase my digital content and career portfolio.

By May 2020, I will be graduating from IIT, when my career as a mechanical engineer begins. As I am interested in the field of energy, I hope to be a job searching candidate who has multiple work related experience and also be able to present it to future employers with a professional portfolio. In the long term, I wish to further improve the knowledge I have learnt from this class and contribute it to my future career.
